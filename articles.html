        <h1>Democracy or Delusion?</h1>
            <h2>By Rohan Vishwakarma </h2> 
            <p>We are being told that democracy is the best form of 
            government, it’s hard for me to admit this.  
            We’re often reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s famous words: 
            “Democracy is of the people, by the people, for the people.” 
            But the older I get, the more I feel that democracy has 
            become something else entirely. It feels like it’s for the 
            loudest, by the largest, and of the most misled. 
            When I look around—especially as an Indian—I see a system 
            that rewards manipulation more than merit, marketing over 
            morals. It’s a numbers game, where the most votes win, not 
            the best ideas. And that’s not just a problem. That’s 
            dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Rule of the Mass, not of the wise </h3> 
            <p>Let’s talk honestly. In India, elections are no longer about 
            finding the most capable leader. They’re about who can 
            promise more. Free electricity, free water, free this, free 
            that—leaders today are selling dreams they never intend to 
            fulfil. 
            And we the people are voting not for visionaries, but for 
            campaign slogans. We’ve mistaken charm for competence. 
            We’ve chosen the loudest speaker in the room and ignored 
            the quiet ones who could actually lead us somewhere better. 
            Think of it this way: if you were on an airplane, who would 
            the passengers vote for the pilot? The who one promises 
            everyone a luxury seat, but can’t even fly the plane, or the 
            other who is a trained pilot but offers no false comforts? In 
            democracy, the crowd often chooses the sweet-talker over 
            the skilled professional. That’s exactly what we’ve done, time 
            and again. 
            We call this freedom. But what kind of freedom is it when our 
            choices are built on illusions? 
            True freedom isn't the right to pick your favourite toothpaste 
            or choose from 20 brands of chips. True freedom is the ability 
            to help shape the direction of your country—to be 
            productive, to live with dignity, and to know that the system 
            around you work for the truth, not just for the votes.</p> 

            <h3>That comes late Is Injustice </h3> 
            <p>One of the worst parts is our justice system. If you’ve ever 
            had to fight a case in court, or known someone who has, you 
            know this truth: justice in a democracy is often delayed, and 
            justice delayed is justice denied. People wait years for their 
            voices to be heard, while the powerful get swift judgments 
            and endless protection. 
            That’s not equality that was promised in democracy. </p>

            <h3>Leaders or Salesmen?</h3> 
            <p>leaders have become salesman. They don’t need vision 
            anymore—they need viral slogans. They don’t need to solve 
            problems—they just need to look like they’re doing 
            something. We elect them not for their ideas, but for their 
            popularity and similarity. 
            And that’s what democracy now produces: marketing 
            experts. Not nation builders.</p>
             
            <h3>There a Better Way? Let’s Talk About It</h3> 
            <p>Maybe you think I’m being too critical. But let’s just take a 
            moment and look at other systems—not to adopt them 
            blindly, but to learn what we’re missing. 
            <b>Communism,</b> for example, has been depicted as an enemy in 
            so many ways. But at its heart, it tries to do one thing right: 
            “make sure no one is left behind”. It believes in equal 
            opportunity, fair access to resources, and a life of dignity for 
            all. Yes, it can become rigid and authoritarian. But at least it 
            doesn’t treat healthcare or education as luxuries, like 
            capitalism often does. 
            <b>Capitalism,</b> on the other hand, gives you choice. It rewards 
            innovation. But it’s cold. Ruthless. In capitalism, if you can’t 
            run fast, you get crushed. People become numbers. Lives are 
            measured in profit margins. The rich soar, the poor survive or 
            don’t. 
            And then there’s Ram Rajya—a system inspired by the 
            idealized rule of Lord Rama. Let’s not get caught up in religion 
            here. Ram Rajya isn’t about temples or rituals. It’s about 
            morality in leadership. Imagine a country where leaders truly 
            care, where justice is swift and fair, where no one is rejected, 
            and where ruling is seen as a responsibility—not a way to get 
            rich. 
            Of course, <b>Ram Rajya</b> is a utopia. But even utopias can be 
            useful if they help us aim higher.</p>

            <h3>So, What Do We Need?</h3>
            <p>I don’t think we need to throw out every system and start 
            over. I think we need to be honest about what’s working and 
            what’s not. We can learn from communism’s compassion, 
            capitalism’s efficiency, democracy’s inclusiveness, and Ram 
            Rajya’s morality. 
            But what we absolutely do is stop pretending that democracy, 
            just because it gives everyone a vote, is automatically just or 
            fair. It’s not. Not when the vote can be bought. Not when the 
            uninformed drown out the voices of the wise. Not when the 
            f
            inal goal is winning, instead of serving.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts: Let’s Dare to Imagine Better</h3>
            <p>So, here’s my plea—not to tear democracy down, but to stop 
            treating it like a sacred cow. Let’s question it. Let’s challenge 
            it. Let’s improve it or replace it with something that works 
            better. 
            Shouldn’t we ask if a farmer in distress deserves the same 
            attention as a billionaire with a failed startup? Shouldn’t we 
            ask whether slogans and freebies are a good enough reason 
            to trust someone with a nation’s future? Shouldn’t we stop 
            calling this freedom when most of us are still trapped in 
            poverty, broken systems, and endless waiting? 
            I don’t want votes. I want vision and purpose. 
            Maybe democracy was once our hope. But unless it changes, 
            it’s becoming our delusion.</p>
